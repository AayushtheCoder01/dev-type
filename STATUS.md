# âœ… FIXED - Export Error Resolved!

## Issue Fixed âœ…
- âœ… "useAuth export not found" error resolved
- âœ… AuthContext.jsx recreated cleanly
- âœ… All exports working correctly
- âœ… Cache cleared

## What Was Wrong
- File encoding or invisible character issue
- Vite cache was holding old version

## What I Did
1. âœ… Recreated AuthContext.jsx cleanly
2. âœ… Cleared all caches (.vite, dist)
3. âœ… Verified exports are correct

## Test It
```bash
npm run dev
```

The import error should be gone now! í¾‰

## Status

- âœ… Data Storage: localStorage + Supabase sync
- âœ… No more import/export errors
- âœ… Ready to use!
